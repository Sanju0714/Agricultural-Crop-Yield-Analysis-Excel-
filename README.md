# 📊 Agricultural Crop Yield Analysis – Excel Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing agricultural crop yield data across various Indian states and districts using **Microsoft Excel**.  
The aim is to transform raw agricultural data into meaningful insights and present them through an **interactive Excel dashboard** that supports data-driven agricultural analysis and decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze crop yield trends across states and districts  
- Identify high-performing and low-performing crops  
- Study the impact of rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and irrigation  
- Build an interactive Excel dashboard for easy exploration of insights  

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains agricultural and environmental information, including:
- State and District  
- Crop Name and Season  
- Area Cultivated  
- Production and Yield  
- Rainfall and Temperature  
- Fertilizer Used and Irrigation Type  

**Derived Metric:** Yield (Kg/Ha)

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- State-wise and district-wise crop yield analysis  
- Crop-wise productivity comparison  
- Seasonal yield trends  
- Rainfall and temperature impact analysis  
- Interactive dashboard for dynamic analysis  

---

## 🎛 Slicers Used
The dashboard includes slicers for interactive filtering:
- **State** – Analyze performance by selected state  
- **District** – Drill down into district-level insights  
- **Crop** – Compare productivity across crops  
- **Season** – Analyze seasonal variations (Kharif, Rabi, Zaid)  
- **Year-Month** – Track trends over time at a monthly level  
- **Irrigation Type** – Compare productivity by irrigation method  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Crop productivity varies significantly across different regions  
- Rainfall and irrigation type have a strong influence on yield  
- Some regions show higher input usage with relatively lower output, indicating efficiency gaps
